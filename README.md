# Welcome!
Welcome to BlueENGINE: A Black Ops: II Scripting Engine meant for Developers to Mod Black Ops: II with ease!

# What is BlueENGINE?
BlueENGINE is a Scripting Engine which has various features, BlueENGINE is still in Progress (Development) and will take awhile but soon should be quite nice to use compared to GSCs :)
BlueENGINE it's self has 2 primary features which is; Console, and Lua Scripts

Console: Console is basically a Console for Developers which can run custom Code (Lua) w/o running using the Scripts Feature, the Console is free for anyone to use (It's like Garry's Mod console on steroids)

Lua Scripts: Lua Scripts is just well "Lua Scripts", it is a custom Runner which'll run .lua and .txt files (These scripts is in "t6r/blueengine/scripts")
