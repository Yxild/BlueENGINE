# Welcome!
Welcome to BlueENGINE: A Black Ops: II Scripting Engine meant for Developers to Mod Black Ops: II with ease!

<hr>

# What is BlueENGINE?
BlueENGINE is a Scripting Engine which has various features, BlueENGINE is still in Progress (Development) and will take awhile but soon should be quite nice to use compared to GSCs :)
BlueENGINE it's self has 2 primary features which is; Console, and Lua Scripts

Console: Console is basically a Console for Developers which can run custom Code (Lua) w/o running using the Scripts Feature, the Console is free for anyone to use (It's like Garry's Mod console on steroids)

Lua Scripts: Lua Scripts is just well "Lua Scripts", it is a custom Runner which'll run .lua and .txt files (These scripts is in "t6r/blueengine/scripts")

# Why BlueENGINE?
It basically is just GSC scripts on steroids, it's actually fairly undetectable as it runs w/ XOR'd scripts and a Custom Lua State (This means it's like difficult finding everything), it's highly secure and fast but don't qoute me on that one as it still can run I/O library and URLs so I'll need to patch that at some point

BlueENGINE's Lua State runs off of Lua 5.4.6 which is fairly recent (latest afaik).
